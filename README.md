# Lederhosen Story Time

A collaborative storytelling project where team members contribute humorous sentences to build a creative narrative incorporating German vocabulary.

## Project Overview

This repository contains:
- **dictionary.txt** - A curated list of 22 German words with English translations
- **story.txt** - A collaborative humorous story using German words
- **PullRequest_List.md** - Documentation of cross-team contributions (to be created)

## How It Works

1. **Team members** create branches and add sentences to the story
2. **Each sentence** must use at least one German word from the dictionary
3. **Changes are committed and merged** using Git workflows
4. **Merge conflicts** are resolved collaboratively as a learning experience
5. **Cross-team contributions** are made via Pull Requests to other teams' stories

## Getting Started
