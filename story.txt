One sunny afternoon in Berlin, a competitive Lederhose salesman named Klaus discovered that his prize Bratwurst had been stolen from the Baeckerei on Hauptstrasse. Desperate to recover it, he jumped into his Porsche and raced to the Flughafen, hoping to catch the culprit. What he didn't expect was to find a Hund wearing Dirndel leading to Schloss Eltz, where Rammstein was performing a concert in a Biergarten. The Klimaanlage was broken, Gebaeck was everywhere, and someone had ordered way too much Doener. As Klaus surveyed the chaos with his Apfelkuchen in hand, he realized this was going to be a long story. Naturally, Klaus did what he always does to prepare for a long story, and rushed himself and his hund to the nearest schloss for the finest dirndel to don.
